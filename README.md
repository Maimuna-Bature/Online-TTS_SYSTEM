# My-TTS System

My-TTS System is a web-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application built with Python and Flask, created as my final year project. This tool allows users to convert typed text or uploaded `.txt`/`.docx` files into natural-sounding speech using Microsoft Edge TTS voices. The interface is clean, modern, and responsiveâ€”making it easy to use on any device.

**Key Features:**
- Convert text or documents to speech instantly
- Choose from multiple English voices and accents
- Download generated audio as MP3 files
- User-friendly, mobile-ready design

Whether you need to listen to your notes, make content more accessible, or simply enjoy hearing your words spoken aloud, My-TTS System is designed to be flexible, reliable, and easy to use.
